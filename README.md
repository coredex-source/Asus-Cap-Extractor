# BiosUtils-Core
- A python program which aims to automate the process of extracting various BIOS file types.

## Currently supports:
- A .cap to .bin converter tested for ASUS cap files, might work with other manufacturers as well.

## I need support and suggestions.
- To be able to make this a big success I would appriciate the help of the community, anyone who can, open an issue in the "Issues" tab with a link to the bios "setup" file which you are unable to extract from the vendor.
- I would recommend using [BiosUtilities by platomav](https://github.com/platomav/BIOSUtilities) first, if you are still unable to get an extracted file then please open an issue here.
- Any useful opened "issue" will be appriciated and your github username will be added to the list of contributors below.
